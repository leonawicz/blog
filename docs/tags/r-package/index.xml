      <description>The tiler package provides a map tile-generator function for creating map tile sets for use with packages such as leaflet.
In addition to generating map tiles based on a common raster layer source, it also handles the non-geographic edge case, producing map tiles from arbitrary images. These map tiles, which have a “simple CRS”, a non-geographic simple Cartesian coordinate reference system, can also be used with leaflet when applying the simple CRS option.</description>

      <description>trekfont is now available on CRAN. This is a simple data package that exposes 107 Star Trek font families. You might not want to use Star Trek fonts for work, but if you are making plots for fun and like Star Trek then these fonts are for you.
This post gives a basic example of one how to load these fonts in R for use in plots. Using external font files is handled by the showtext package, which uses the sysfonts package to load the fonts.</description>
