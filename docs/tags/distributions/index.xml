      <description>The SNAP Climate Analytics Shiny app has been updated. Previously, the app included seasonally and annually aggregated data. With the recent inclusion of monthly data, the number of conditional spatio-temporal climate probability distributions has now increased from a base set of about 13 million unique distributions to over 46 million. The Season dropdown menu now offers annual average, 3-month seasonals, and individual months.
These conditional distributions for historical and projected temperature and precipitation over different geographic regions, time periods, climate models and greenhouse gas emissions scenarios represent the source data sets available in the app.</description>

      <title>Shiny app: Distributions of random variables</title>

      <description>There is a new version of my Distributions of Random Variables Shiny app available. This is a cleaned up modern revision of my original 2013 app series involving random variable probability distributions. The primary change is a switch to ggplot2 from base graphics. I have added this app to my shiny-apps GitHub repository so the source code is available, including a script containing all those pesky plotmath expressions.
The app draws and plots samples from various well known discrete and continuous probability distributions, all of which are available in base R with the single exception of the Pareto distribution.</description>
