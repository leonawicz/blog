      <description>This past year in R has been a good one for me; productive, exciting, different. I decided it was worth taking a moment to reflect and share. Goals were set and met. There were also unexpected changes.
CRANA year ago, at the tail end of 2017, I published my first package to CRAN. Itâ€™s a fun, silly package, but I also had to make a successful case for in the initial review process to distinguish it from other similar works.</description>

      <description>The epubr package provides functions supporting the reading and parsing of internal e-book content from EPUB files. This post briefly highlights the changes from v0.4.0. See the vignette for a more comprehensive introduction.
Minor additionThere is not much to see with the upgrade to version 0.5.0. Only one user function has been added, epub_cat. All this does is allow you to cat chunks of parsed e-book text to the console in a more readable manner.</description>

      <description>The epubr package provides functions supporting the reading and parsing of internal e-book content from EPUB files. E-book metadata and text content are parsed separately and joined together in a tidy, nested tibble data frame.
E-book formatting is non-standard enough across all literature that no function can curate parsed e-book content across an arbitrary collection of e-books, in completely general form, resulting in a singular, consistently formatted output containing all the same variables.</description>
