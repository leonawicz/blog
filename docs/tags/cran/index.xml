      <description>The epubr R package provides functions supporting the reading and parsing of internal e-book content from EPUB files. It has been updated to v0.6.0 on CRAN. This post highlights new functionality. The key improvements focus on cases where EPUB files have poorly arranged text when loaded into R as a result of their metadata entries and archive file structure.

      <title>My 2018 #rstats year in review</title>

      <description>This past year in R has been a good one for me; productive, exciting, different. I decided it was worth taking a moment to reflect and share. Goals were set and met. There were also unexpected changes.
CRANA year ago, at the tail end of 2017, I published my first package to CRAN. It’s a fun, silly package, but I also had to make a successful case for in the initial review process to distinguish it from other similar works.</description>

      <title>epubr 0.5.0 CRAN release</title>
      <link>/post/epubr-0-5-0-cran-release/</link>

      <description>The epubr package provides functions supporting the reading and parsing of internal e-book content from EPUB files. This post briefly highlights the changes from v0.4.0. See the vignette for a more comprehensive introduction.
Minor additionThere is not much to see with the upgrade to version 0.5.0. Only one user function has been added, epub_cat. All this does is allow you to cat chunks of parsed e-book text to the console in a more readable manner.</description>

      <title>tiler 0.2.0 CRAN release: Create map tiles from R</title>
      <link>/post/tiler-0-2-0-cran-release-create-map-tiles-from-r/</link>

      <description>The tiler package provides a map tile-generator function for creating map tile sets for use with packages such as leaflet.
In addition to generating map tiles based on a common raster layer source, it also handles the non-geographic edge case, producing map tiles from arbitrary images. These map tiles, which have a “simple CRS”, a non-geographic simple Cartesian coordinate reference system, can also be used with leaflet when applying the simple CRS option.</description>

      <title>epubr 0.4.0 CRAN release</title>
      <link>/post/epubr-0-4-0-cran-release/</link>

      <description>The epubr package provides functions supporting the reading and parsing of internal e-book content from EPUB files. E-book metadata and text content are parsed separately and joined together in a tidy, nested tibble data frame.
E-book formatting is non-standard enough across all literature that no function can curate parsed e-book content across an arbitrary collection of e-books, in completely general form, resulting in a singular, consistently formatted output containing all the same variables.</description>
