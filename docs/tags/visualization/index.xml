      <title>tiler 0.2.0 CRAN release: Create map tiles from R</title>

      <description>The tiler package provides a map tile-generator function for creating map tile sets for use with packages such as leaflet.
In addition to generating map tiles based on a common raster layer source, it also handles the non-geographic edge case, producing map tiles from arbitrary images. These map tiles, which have a “simple CRS”, a non-geographic simple Cartesian coordinate reference system, can also be used with leaflet when applying the simple CRS option.</description>

      <title>Climate explorer update: monthly data and delta change</title>

      <description>The SNAP Climate Analytics Shiny app has been updated. Previously, the app included seasonally and annually aggregated data. With the recent inclusion of monthly data, the number of conditional spatio-temporal climate probability distributions has now increased from a base set of about 13 million unique distributions to over 46 million. The Season dropdown menu now offers annual average, 3-month seasonals, and individual months.
These conditional distributions for historical and projected temperature and precipitation over different geographic regions, time periods, climate models and greenhouse gas emissions scenarios represent the source data sets available in the app.</description>

      <title>Custom images for Shiny dashboard valueBox icons</title>
      <link>/post/custom-images-for-shiny-dashboard-valuebox-icons/</link>

      <guid>/post/custom-images-for-shiny-dashboard-valuebox-icons/</guid>
      <description>The shinydashboard package provides functions like valueBox that conveniently display basic information like summary statistics. In addition to presenting a value and subtitle on a colored background, an icon may be included as well. However, the icon must come from either the Font Awesome or Glyphicon icon libraries and cannot be image files.
I&amp;rsquo;ve provided a gist that shows how to achieve the use of custom icons with local image files stored in an app&amp;rsquo;s www/ directory.</description>

      <description>mapmate is under development and blog posts can become outdated quickly. Up to date mapmate documentation and tutorial examples can be found at the official mapmate Github pages.
mapmate has now been updating from version 0.1.0 to 0.2.0 on Github. The key change is the incorporation of new functions, help docs and code examples focused on network maps, which is a more complex map type not previously covered. The new tutorial content below provides a a couple basic code examples for making network maps with mapmate.</description>

      <title>R animation: global climate change</title>

      <guid>/post/r-animation-global-climate-change/</guid>
      <description>I have posted a new R data animation video. It&amp;rsquo;s an example animation of modeled historical and projected global temperature change from 1850 - 2100. The data prep, analysis, full processing and generation of all sets of still frames for each layer in the video are done using R.
  Typically an ensemble of models would be used but this video is just to demonstrate a basic animation using one climate model, both with a monthly time series and a monthly 10-year moving average time series.</description>

      <title>R animation: global SNAP Shiny app users</title>

      <description>For the blog readers, just a quick heads up that I have posted a new R data animation to YouTube. A complete post will follow, but for now here is the video. It displays the social network of SNAP Shiny app users over about the past year and a half using great circle trajectories on a rotating 3D Earth. It&amp;rsquo;s best in 1080p, but still somewhat degraded for streaming. I&amp;rsquo;ll post the raw source video later as well, which is crystal clear.</description>

      <title>R animation: great circles 3, final draft</title>

      <description>Here is the final draft of my great circle arcs R animation. I made this back in January shortly after my first two drafts, but am only now getting around to sharing it, which is a typical representation of how seldom I can make time for blogging. But given the recent spike in interest (thanks to Urban Demographics for sharing my work) in the first, and roughest, draft, I am motivated to finally share something better.</description>
