# Bio

I am a software developer and data scientist with E Source.
I especially love programming in R, including high performance statistical computing, web application development, data visualization, and dynamic reporting.
I enjoy developing R Shiny apps and creating informative, beautiful graphics.

I also enjoy networking with other R developers, data analysts, researchers, and useRs around the globe.
While I don't have a lot of time to [blog](https://leonawicz.github.io/blog/), I post more frequent updates on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/leonawicz). Some of my R code is available on [Github](https://github.com/leonawicz).
